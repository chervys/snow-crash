## Level13

We need to execute `level13` as UID 4242. To do so, we can create a new user
but we cannot do it in the snow-crash VM. We download the binary to
another VM on which we are root, create a user with UID 4242 and run the program.
It prints the following line:  
`your token is 2A31L79asukciNyi8uppkEuSx`
