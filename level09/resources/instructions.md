## Level09

We have an encrypted `token` file and the program that encrypted it.
It was simply encrypted by adding 0 to the first character, 1 to the second, 2 to the third...  
To decrypt it, we create a script `script.py` that will revert the encryption process.
It gives us the original token that we use to log into flag09 and we `getflag`.
